# 🌡️ AI-Powered Real-Time Heat Stress & Environmental Risk Detection System

## 🚀 Overview

Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and dangerous, especially in countries like India where millions of outdoor workers are exposed to extreme temperatures.

Most weather applications only provide general data such as temperature and AQI. They do not analyze an individual's real-time physiological condition or predict personalized heat exhaustion risk.

This project introduces an AI-based system that detects human heat stress using computer vision and combines it with environmental intelligence to predict real-time heat risk.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Extreme heat conditions cause:

* Heatstroke
* Dehydration
* Worker fatigue
* Reduced productivity
* Increased hospital admissions

Current systems fail because they:

* Only show weather data
* Ignore individual physiological conditions
* Do not provide personalized real-time alerts

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This system integrates **Computer Vision + Machine Learning + Environmental Intelligence** to create a hybrid heat risk prediction engine.

---

## 🧠 System Working

### 1. Physiological Stress Detection

Using:

* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* Deep Learning Models

The system analyzes:

* Eye fatigue and blink rate
* Facial redness intensity
* Skin brightness variation
* Micro facial stress cues

Output:
**Physiological Stress Score (0–100)**

---

### 2. Environmental Intelligence

The system fetches live environmental data:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* UV Index
* Air Quality Index

Output:
**Environmental Stress Score (0–100)**

---

### 3. Hybrid AI Risk Engine

Final Risk Calculation:

```
Final Risk = 0.5 × Physiological Score + 0.5 × Environmental Score
```

Risk Levels:

* 🟢 Safe
* 🟡 Moderate Risk
* 🔴 High Risk

---

## 🔥 Key Features

* Real-time webcam heat stress detection
* Hybrid AI-based risk prediction
* Live environmental data integration
* Personalized safety recommendations
* Voice alert system
* Risk history tracking dashboard
